# 👤 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity professional and systems engineer, passionate about securing systems and empowering others through knowledge.  

With international experience across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, I enjoy leading technical discussions, live demos, and cyber ranges—from capture-the-flag events to real-world threat simulations.

I believe in learning by doing and sharing what works.
